Building:

    Run 'make' to build the code.   'make MODE=debug' will build with debugging info.

    The packages you need on Ubuntu are:
        mesa-common-dev
        libglu1-mesa-dev
        freeglut3-dev
        libglew-dev
        libsdl-dev
        libpng-dev
        libboost-all-dev

    You may also need ISPC, depending on the day...

    (It should work for Mac OSX and other Linux distributions as well, with the appropriate package equivalents.  Windows is untested.)

Running the program:

    Run the program with './raytracer input_scene'

    Use the mouse and 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', and 'e' to move the camera around. The keys translate the camera, and left and right mouse buttons rotate the camera.

    'f' will save the current frame to an image.

Options:

    -r:
        Raytraces the scene and saves to the output file without loading a window or creating an opengl context.
    -d width height
        The dimensions of image to raytrace (and window if using an opengl context. Defaults to width=800, height=600.
    output_file:
        The output file in which to write the rendered images if using -r.  If not specified, default timestamped filenames are used.
